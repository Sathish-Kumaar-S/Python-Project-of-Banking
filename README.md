# Python-Project-of-Banking
This project's objective is to equip Thera Bank's Retail Marketing Department with an advanced predictive model to pinpoint potential personal loan customers within the current liability customer base. This is anticipated to boost campaign success rates, reduce costs, and drive overall growth and profitability for the bank.
